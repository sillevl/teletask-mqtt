## Configuration file

```json
{
    "teletask": {
        "host": "192.168.1.1",
        "port": 55957
    },
    "mqtt": {
        "host": "192.168.1.2",
        "port": 1883
    }
}
```

If the broker is configured with a `username` and `password`, just add them to the `mqtt` object:

```json
{
    "teletask": {
        "host": "192.168.1.1",
        "port": 55957
    },
    "mqtt": {
        "host": "192.168.1.2",
        "port": 1883,
        "username": "foo",
        "password": "bar"
    }
}
```

## Docker

```
docker run -it -v /path-to-config:/config sillevl/teletask-mqtt
```

## MQTT Topics

### Subscribing

Listening for new values

```
teletask/[function]/[number]
```

example:

```
teletask/relay/20
```

This will subscribe to the state of relay 20

### Publishing

Updating state

```
teletask/relay/20/set
```

To change the state of relay 20, a value of `on` or `off` must be send to this topic

## Functions

### Relay

State values can be:

* on
* off

## Integration with Home Assitant

You can integrate the `teletask-mqtt` with Home Assitant by configuring the same MQTT broker for both services. You can use a separate MQTT broker, or the internal Home Assistant broker.

### Light example configuration

An example of integrating a `light` in the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`

The number in the `topic`s should be configured with the number that is being assigned within the Teletask configuration.

```yaml
mqtt:
  light:  
        command_topic: "teletask/relay/16/set"
        state_topic: "teletask/relay/16"
        name: Kitchen
        payload_on: "on"
        payload_off: "off"
        unique_id: "teletask/relay/16"
```

### Sensor example configuration

An example of integrating a `sensor` in the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`

The number in the `topic`s should be configured with the number that is being assigned within the Teletask configuration.

```yaml
mqtt:
  sensor:
        state_topic: "teletask/sensor/12"
        name: Kitchen
        unit_of_measurement: 'Â°C'
```
